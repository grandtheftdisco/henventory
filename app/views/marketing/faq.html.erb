    <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl pb-2">❓ What are "flock mode" and "layer mode"?</h2>
    
    <div class="pl-10">
      <p class="py-2">🪺<b>Flock mode</b> allows you to track <i>only</i> how many eggs your flock lays, and what time they're collected.</p>

      <p class="pt-2 pb-5">🐔<b>Layer mode</b>, on the other hand, allows you to collect data on individual hens: how many eggs they lay throughout the week, month, and year.</p>
      
      <div class="bg-blue-100 border border-0.5 rounded-2xl px-4 mb-5 py-2">
        <p class="font-semibold text-lg">➡️ You might want to use <b>flock mode</b> if:</p>
        <ul class="pb-2">
          <li>🥚 you have a small farm with too many chickens to keep track of on an individual basis</li>
          <li>🥚 you're more interested in how many eggs you get than which chickens are laying them</li>
          <li>🥚 your hens lay eggs that look very similar (or identical) to one another</li>
          <li>🥚 you only check for eggs once or twice a day</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="pb-2">
          <li>🥚 you can tell at a glance which of your hens laid a particular egg</li>
          <li>🥚 you have a few different breeds and want to compare their productivity, peak egg-laying seasons, etc.</li>
          <li>🥚 you check for eggs frequently throughout the day</li>

      <p><b>What's an alpha version?</b></p>
      <p class="pb-2">Well, if you've heard of a <i>beta version</i> before, just imagine something less polished than that.</p>
      <p>The formal definition of an alpha version is:</p>
      <div class="px-8 py-3 italic text-sm"> 
        <blockquote cite="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/ dictionary/english/alpha-version"><p>a version of a piece of software that is made available for testing, typically by employees of the company that is developing it, before its general release.</p></blockquote>
