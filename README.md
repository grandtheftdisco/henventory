# üê£ Welcome to Henventory!
- This is my first-ever web app: built in Ruby on Rails, styled with Tailwind, and lightly seasoned with Stimulus.js
- If you're here for my portfolio, check out the Process section below for a look behind the scenes!

## ‚è≤Ô∏è Elevator Pitch
- Henventory helps chicken farmers keep track of egg production.
- Whether you have a small backyard flock or several dozen hens, Henventory will answer questions like:
  - How many eggs do I get per day, on average? Does it change with the seasons?
  - Do my Rhode Island Reds lay more than my Barred Rocks?
  - Whcih of my chickens is Employee of the Month?
 
## üëÄ See It in Action!
Go check out [Henventory](https://www.henventory.com) in production!
- *-slaps hood-* She's in alpha[^1], folks, so go easy on her.

## üíª How to Run Henventory Locally
- clone as per usual
- [install Rails 8](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/install_ruby_on_rails.html) if you don't already have it
- in your terminal, navigate to the root dir and run `bin/rails server`
- then, visit `localhost:3000` in your browser
- from there, you'll be able to explore the public side of Henventory

[^1]: I don't have all of the data-analysis tools up and running yet; we're growing a nice crop of data this spring so we've got something to work with in beta development!
