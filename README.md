# üê£ Welcome to Henventory!
- This is my first-ever web app: built in Ruby on Rails, styled with Tailwind, and lightly seasoned with Stimulus.js
- If you're here for my portfolio, check out the Process section below for a look behind the scenes!

## ‚è≤Ô∏è Elevator Pitch
- Henventory helps chicken farmers keep track of egg production.
- Whether you have a small backyard flock or several dozen hens, Henventory will answer questions like:
  - How many eggs do I get per day, on average? Does it change with the seasons?
  - Do my Rhode Island Reds lay more than my Barred Rocks?
  - Whcih of my chickens is Employee of the Month?
 
## üëÄ See It in Action!
Go check out [Henventory](https://www.henventory.com) in production!
- *-slaps hood-* She's in alpha[^1], folks, so go easy on her.

## üíª How to Run Henventory Locally
1. clone as per usual
2. [install Rails 8](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/install_ruby_on_rails.html) if you don't already have it
3. in your terminal, navigate to the root dir and run `bin/rails server`
4. then, visit `localhost:3000` in your browser
5. from there, you'll be able to explore the public side of Henventory
6. to get the full experience, sign up for an account in dev

[^1]: I don't have all of the data-analysis tools up and running yet; we're growing a nice crop of data this spring so we've got something to work with in beta development!

# ‚öíÔ∏è PROCESS ‚öíÔ∏è

## Goals
- The goal of this project was, primarily, to help my family.
- The other goal was more technical: to learn Rails.
  - Tutorials are great, but what better way to learn than to build something?
 
## Team
- I could **never** call this a solo project and be able to sleep at night.
- My technical mentor Bookis has been indispensable throughout the process.

## Stack
- Ruby on Rails | Stimulus.js | Tailwind
  - Development DB: SQLite
  - Production DB: Postgres[^2]
- Deployment platform: Render

## Timeframe
- alpha: January - March 2025
- beta: *in development*

## Outcomes
- I have two loyal users: the people I built this app for.
  - My main motivation for building this app was to make their lives easier, so any other users -- or anything else I've learned along the way -- well, that's just lagniappe[^3].
 
[^2]: Remind me to *start* with Postgres next time.
[^3]: (pronounced '*LAN-yap*' -- Cajun for "extra stuff" )
